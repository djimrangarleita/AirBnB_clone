# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

## Concepts

For this project, we expect you to look at these concepts:

- [Python packages](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/66)
- [AirBnB clone](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/74)

## Background Context

### Welcome to the AirBnB clone project

Before starting, please read the **AirBnB** concept page.

#### First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.

This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the **AirBnB clone**. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration...

Each task is linked and will help you to:

- put in place a parent class (called `BaseModel`) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
- create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
- create all classes used for AirBnB (`User`, `State`, `City`, `Place`...) that inherit from `BaseModel`
- create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
- create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

### What's a command interpreter

Do you remember the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
Update attributes of an object
Destroy an object
